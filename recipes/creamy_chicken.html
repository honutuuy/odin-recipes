    <p>In this crowd-pleasing recipe, chicken is seared along with asparagus, resulting in perfectly golden meat and tender-yet-crispy stalks.</p>
    <p>Serve with rice, pasta, or potatoes, and if you want to vary the cheese or herbs to your taste, the floor is yours. Seasonings and herbs that work well with asparagus include cayenne, dill, garlic, thyme, parsley, sage, and tarragon. Luckily, many of these ingredients also work great with chicken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>4 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped shallot</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>3 thyme sprigs, plus leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh asparagusm trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour and granulated garlic in a shallow bowl or baking dish until combined. Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, dredge chicken in flour mixture to coat both sides, and shake off excess; set aside on a large plate.</li>
        <li>Heat oil and butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Once butter is melted and shimmering, add chicken breasts to skillet, and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate. Do not wipe skillet clean.</li>
        <li>While chicken browns, transfer remaining flour mixture to a small bowl. Add 3 tablespoons chicken broth, and whisk until smooth to make a slurry; set aside until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat under skillet to medium; add shallot, and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 30 seconds. Add wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of skillet, about 1 minute. Stir in thyme sprigs and 1 cup broth. Gradually whisk in slurry mixture until combined; bring to a simmer around edges of skillet over medium-high. Remove skillet from heat. Add browned chicken to the skillet; arrange asparagus around chicken, and immediately transfer skillet to the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, and divide chicken evenly among 4 plates.</li>
        <li>Stir crème fraîche and Parmesan into asparagus and broth mixture until fully combined. Spoon asparagus and cream sauce over chicken. Garnish with thyme leaves.</li>
    </ol>
